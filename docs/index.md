The **Fetch Wallet**, originally forked from the [Keplr wallet](https://github.com/chainapsis/keplr-wallet), is a generic wallet for interacting with the Fetch blockchain network and other ledgers built using the Cosmos-SDK, and supports the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol.

Some of its highlights include:

- Private keys and mnemonics are encrypted (using scrypt) and are stored locally on device. This means neither Fetch nor the websites visited have access to these sensitive data. 
- Multiple accounts on the Fetch ledger and other Cosmos-based ledgers.
- Support for Ledger hardware wallets for enhanced security.
- Native and IBC token transfers.

## Compatibility

The Fetch wallet works on all Chromium-based web browsers, including [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/), [Brave](https://brave.com), [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge) and [Decentr](https://decentr.net).

## Get the Wallet

Install the Fetch wallet from the [Chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fetchai-network-wallet/ellkdbaphhldpeajbepobaecooaoafpg/related?hl=en-GB).

!!! info
    At this time, you cannot run the [Keplr](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keplr/dmkamcknogkgcdfhhbddcghachkejeap?hl=en) and Fetch wallets together because they interfere. Please disable the Keplr wallet before using the Fetch wallet.
