## Intro

Clicking the "Stake" button on the dashboard should open the [ledger explorer]() in a new tab.
See [ledger explorer staking docs](TODO: lnk me! - point to staking under explorer (how to stake using; medium article)) for more information.

## Claim rewards

If the active account has delegated tokens, a "Pending Staking Reward" section should appear above the "Stake" section on the dashboard. Clicking the "claim" button will generate a transaction which the wallet will then ask you to approve which will distribute all the account's rewards to its balance.

To claim rewards from validators individually see the [ledger explorer staking documentation](TODO: link me!).
