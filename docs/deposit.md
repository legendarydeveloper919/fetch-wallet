## How to top up your account

To transfer funds to the active account you will need to copy its address to the sending wallet or application.

Clicking on the account address towards the top of the dashboard (below the account name) will copy it to the clipboard. This address can be used to send supported tokens using the (native) fetch network.

Clicking on the "Deposit" button opens a modal with a QR code which contains the address of the active account.

## Troubleshooting

If your origin wallet says that the address (which should start with the word "fetch") is invalid, it is probably expecting an ethereum address (beginning with "0x") and is most likely trying to send [ERC20 FET](TODO: link me!).
In this case, you need to use the [token bridge](https://token-bridge.fetch.ai/) to swap your ERC20 FET for native FET.
